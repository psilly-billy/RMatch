    "short_bio": "Ever since my parents signed me up for an IT course when I was 12, where I got my hands dirty with MS-DOS, Norton Commander, Microsoft Office, and the iconic Windows 95, I was hooked. That course wasn't just an introduction to the IT world; it was the beginning of a lifelong fascination. By 14, I had my first PC, and it was game on: breaking it, fixing it, and taking it apart just to see how it ticked. There's something magical about how lines of code and pieces of hardware can transform lives and change the world. It's like a kind of magic that's real and powerful.\nEven during my years focusing on photography and art, I couldn't take my eye off the tech world. Keeping up with the latest in tech wasn't just a hobby; it was part of who I am. It probably played a big role in my dive into machine learning and artificial intelligence. The blend of technology and creativity was irresistible, offering a canvas to paint on with the codes and algorithms.\nDiving deep into machine learning demanded a commitment level I hadn't anticipated. Balancing a full-time job while dedicating 90% of my free time to mastering a new skill was daunting.\nYet, it was one of the most rewarding challenges I've faced.\nParticipating in the Generation's GCP course opened a new chapter for me. It wasn't just about going back to a classroom setting. It was about collaboration, active engagement, and a deep dive into how my skills could translate in the real world. Furthermore, it pushed me to analyze my capabilities, learn how to support others, and tackle problems head-on.\nThroughout my journey my curiosity, my knack for solving problems, being creative, and working well with others has really been what's kept me going. From figuring out tech puzzles to running a photoshoot, my ability to find solutions where others might hit a wall has always made me stand out. Looking ahead, I'm pumped to join a team that's all about innovation, learning, and adding a bit of magic to what we do every day. Here's to starting a new chapter where I'm not just growing, but really thriving, sharing what I know, and taking on challenges with folks who are as excited about tech as I am."
